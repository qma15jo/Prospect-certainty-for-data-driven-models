# Prospect-certainty-for-data-driven-models
This repo contains the steps of the prospect certainty method to ensure reproducibility. 

Kindly follow the latest Release...
This code was developed from scratch to illustrate the Prospect Certainty method for data-driven models. It features a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a randomly generated dataset. The final results reflect the model's simplicity and the dataset's lack of coherence. However, this code is intended solely to facilitate the reproducibility of the method.

Additionally, please note that a comprehensive, tested package will be released soon.
